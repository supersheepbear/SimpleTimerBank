# Simple Timer Bank

A sophisticated desktop application built with PySide6 that allows you to manage time as a resource. Bank your time, then spend it on focused work sessions using a flexible timer system. This tool is designed to help you stay productive by making you conscious of how you spend your time.

## Core Concepts

-   **Time as a Resource**: Think of time like money in a bank. You can deposit it, withdraw it, and spend it.
-   **The Time Bank**: Your central repository of available time. The main display shows your current balance.
-   **Transactions**: Instantly add or remove time from your bank using the "Manage Bank Balance" controls.
-   **Timer Sessions**: "Spend" your banked time by running a countdown timer for a specific duration.
-   **Overdraft Mode**: If a timer session runs out, it doesn't just stop. It automatically enters "Overdraft Mode" and begins withdrawing time directly from your bank balance, complete with sound and system notifications.
-   **Refunds**: If you stop a timer session early, the unused time is instantly refunded to your bank.

## Features

-   **Digital Clock Displays**: Clear, easy-to-read displays for both your bank balance and the active timer.
-   **Intuitive Transaction Controls**:
    -   Deposit, instantly withdraw, or set your bank balance to a specific value.
    -   Use relative preset buttons (`+15m`, `-30m`, etc.) to quickly adjust the transaction amount.
-   **Flexible Timer Controls**: Start, pause, resume, and stop timer sessions with clear, expanding buttons.
-   **Audio-Visual Alerts**: Receive non-blocking system notifications with custom sounds for key events like overdraft activation and bank depletion.
-   **Persistent State**: Your time bank balance is automatically saved when you close the application and reloaded on startup.
-   **Polished UI**: A clean, visually organized interface with distinct sections for different actions.
