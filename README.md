# Simple Timer Bank 🏦

Simple Timer Bank is a desktop application for managing your personal "free time." It helps you balance productive work with leisure activities like gaming 🎮, watching movies 🍿, or any other hobbies by treating your free time as a resource in a "bank."

For full feature details and usage guides, please see the [**Official Documentation**](https://supersheepbear.github.io/SimpleTimerBank/).

## How It Works

-   **Bank Your Time 💰**: Deposit time you've set aside for leisure into your personal time bank.
-   **Spend Your Time ⏳**: When you're ready for a break, start a timer to begin "withdrawing" and consuming your banked time.
-   **Overdraft Feature ⚠️**: If your timer runs out but you're not ready to stop, the app automatically enters "overdraft mode." It will start drawing from your main bank balance, preventing abrupt interruptions while keeping track of the extra time used.
-   **Automatic Refunds 🔄**: If you end a session early, any unused time from the timer is automatically returned to your bank.

## Features

-   **Digital Clock Displays**: Clear, easy-to-read displays for both your bank balance and the active timer.
-   **Intuitive Transaction Controls**:
    -   Deposit, instantly withdraw, or set your bank balance to a specific value.
    -   Use relative preset buttons (`+15m`, `-30m`, etc.) to quickly adjust the transaction amount.
-   **Flexible Timer Controls**: Start, pause, resume, and stop timer sessions with clear, expanding buttons.
-   **Audio-Visual Alerts**: Receive non-blocking system notifications with custom sounds for key events like overdraft activation and bank depletion.
-   **Persistent State**: Your time bank balance is automatically saved when you close the application and reloaded on startup.
-   **Polished UI**: A clean, visually organized interface with distinct sections for different actions.
