# Welcome to SimpleTimerBank

**SimpleTimerBank** is a focused, easy-to-use desktop application designed for effective time management. It's built on the concept of a time "bank," where you can deposit or withdraw time, and then spend that balance using a built-in countdown timer.

This tool is perfect for anyone who uses time-blocking techniques, needs to track work hours against a budget, or simply wants a more tangible way to manage their daily available time.

## Core Features

- **Time Balance**: Easily add or subtract time from your central time bank. The balance is always visible and is saved automatically when you close the app.
- **Countdown Timer**: Start a countdown timer that consumes your time balance in real-time. Pause or stop the timer at any moment.
- **Data Persistence**: Your remaining time balance is saved when you exit and automatically reloaded the next time you start the application.
- **Standalone Executable**: The entire application is packaged into a single folder for easy execution, with no installation required.
